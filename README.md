## Examples

The server SYSLOG gather logs from all networt device. The logs are store in path using the pattern `/var/syslog/{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}/{device-name}.log`
The archive folder, is on the same server on the folder `/archives`.
Ths script must get the logs from the source folder `/var/syslog/{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}/{device-name}.log`, compress the logs to the folder `/archives/var/syslog/{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}/{device-name}.log.bz2`. If the copy is success, delete logs from source folder older or equal at `--retention`.
The script must provide a log file, with the summary of parameters used, the number of files copied, with the initial size and the destination size, and the total time of script execution.
